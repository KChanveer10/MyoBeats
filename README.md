MyoBeats: A Heart Rate Monitoring App

      In the world full of Race. We need to slow down and check the working and condition of the heart. Most people neglect their heart health condition at a lower stage and these small anomalies become large in the long run. To identify heart disease at an early stage, we need certain techniques and technology. To provide free app service for normal people as well as patients, so that they can check their heart beats, which ultimately gives the status of their Heart-Health. We are developing a simple app with Flutter that measures heart rate variability and displays it in a chart using only the phone’s camera and flash. We are using the technique which is also used by device-pulse oximeter, called Photoplethysmography (PPG).
      Photoplethysmography will be explained in simple words as follows: [3] Shining a light into a blood-irrigated tissue, we can measure the variability of reflected light and extract the variation of blood flow. As we all know, blood flow is dependent on the heart rate, so we can calculate the heart rate using the blood flow variation. So, in our mobile app, we’ll glow the camera’s flash and calculate the intensity of light which comes back using the smartphone’s camera. More precisely, we will find the mean value of all the pixel’s intensity in the camera photograph. Then, if we surround the camera and flashlight with our fingers, the intensity calculated will change with the flow of blood.
